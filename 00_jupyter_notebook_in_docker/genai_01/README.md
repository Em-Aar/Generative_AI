# Setting up Jupyter Notebook in Docker Container
In this step, we have created a Jupyter Notebook container to run our services in Docker.

## Steps:
1. Create a poetry project with `poetry new genai_01`.
2. Create a Dockerfile insided `genai_01` directory.
3. Create a `compose.yaml` file.
4. Add services to `compose.yaml` file.
5. Run `docker compose up -d`.

This will create a Jupyter Notebook container in Docker. This was the first step in setting up Jupyter Notebook in Docker.
In next classes, we'll just create our project without setting jupyter notebook container. However, in this class, we've learnt
how we can setup jupyter notebook container in Docker.
